# Email Message Templates

Many of the automated emails sent to parents and staff can be customised to meet your language requirements. To find the templates, navigate to **Administration → Site Administration → Manage Email Messages**.

Click on **edit** next to the template you wish to edit.

![](assets/screenshots/email-message-templates/email-message-templates-01.png)

Depending on the template you are editing, you may see one or more of the following sections:

-   **Email Subject:** This appears in the email subject line when the message is sent.
-   **Top of Message:** This is where the body is displayed. In emails that include automated report content, this message will appear above the report content.
-   **Bottom of Message:** This section is often omitted for emails that do not include automated report content. Where it is present, it will appear below the emailed report.
-   **Valid Merge Codes:** Each email template provides different merge codes. These merge codes can be used in any of the sections. They must appear exactly as shown with the braces `{}`.

Click on **Save Message** when done.

## The Email Templates

The table below lists the email templates that ADAM provides, grouped by the headings under which they appear on the **Manage Email Messages** screen. Every template is always listed, regardless of which modules your school uses, but a template is only ever sent when the feature it belongs to is in use. The detailed workflow behind each email is covered on the documentation page for the relevant module.

!!! tip
    The wording of most of these emails can be tailored to your school in exactly the way described above — click **edit** next to the template, change the **Email Subject** and message sections, then click **Save Message**. The **Valid Merge Codes** shown on each template tell you which `{codes}` that particular email understands.

## Editing the Default Template

Where schools have demanding CI requirements, ADAM allows for the customisation and modification of the default email template.

!!! warning
    Kindly note that we do not provide any support for the modification or formatting of email messages. This feature is provided for your use entirely at your risk. In the event that your email template is changed in any way, our only offer of support is to replace this with the default message template.

Navigate to **Administration → Site Administration → Manage Email Messages**. Click on **edit** next to the **All Email** template, listed under the **General** heading.

![](assets/screenshots/email-message-templates/email-message-templates-02.png)

Unlike other message templates, this one does not provide a “rich” text editor and, instead, provides the raw HTML that is used to format every message - including the other templates that ADAM lists.

![](assets/screenshots/email-message-templates/email-message-templates-03.png)

Note carefully the four merge codes. Importantly, the `{body}` and `{footer}` merge codes MUST be included in the template.

!!! warning 
    Please be aware that while this allows you to enter and CSS and HTML code you wish, not all CSS styling and HTML is honoured by the email client that will show the email to the final recipient. Additionally, there is no standard as to which email clients honour which CSS directives, meaning that to get an email to display consistently across all email viewers is, in short, impossible. A simple Google search on “email css styling” will reveal as much. You are thus advised to keep your styling general and also to test it across as many email clients as possible to ensure that emails are displayed correctly and are legible in their final destinations. ***ADAM will not attempt to make any suggestions or corrections and will assume that you know what you’re doing!***

Alternatively, there are a number of HTML template generators available who will ensure that your emails look as consistent as they can across different email clients. However, these are normally not free and should be used at your own risk.

Finally, if your school employs a graphic designer, they might be able to assist you with the creation of an HTML template.

### Using banner images

There are two merge codes for banner images: `{bannertop}` and `{bannerbottom}`. These banners should be uploaded in the same place as the [school logos](school-logos.md#school-logos).

!!! warning
    Be aware that these banners are not automatically resized by ADAM. While the banner images can be resized in the CSS of the email (perhaps with a surrounding div tag with fixed dimensions), again be aware that no all email clients will support such modifications and you are advised to upload appropriately sized images that will display correctly for a large number of users without and styling intervention. ***Again, we emphasise the need to test your emails on a wide variety of email clients and platforms!***

### Staff Sender Details and Signatures

When an email is sent by a particular staff member — for example, a message composed in the [Messaging Centre](messaging-centre.md#messaging-centre) — ADAM can personalise the **All Email** template with that sender’s own details. This allows every message to close with the name, position and contact details of the person who sent it, rather than a generic, school-wide signature.

There are two ways to include sender details: a set of text merge codes for the sender’s details, and an image merge code for an uploaded signature graphic. The two can be used together or independently.

#### Sender detail merge codes

In addition to the structural merge codes (`{body}`, `{footer}`, `{bannertop}` and `{bannerbottom}`), the **All Email** template recognises the following codes. Each is replaced with the corresponding detail of the staff member who is sending the message:

-   `{staff_title}` — The sender’s title (e.g. Ms)
-   `{staff_firstname}` — The sender’s first name
-   `{staff_lastname}` — The sender’s last name
-   `{staff_initials}` — The sender’s initials
-   `{staff_department}` — The sender’s department
-   `{staff_position}` — The sender’s position
-   `{staff_email}` — The sender’s email address

These are the same codes that are listed under **Valid Merge Codes** when you edit the **All Email** template. You can combine them with ordinary HTML to build a signature block, for example:

```html
<p>Kind regards,<br>
{staff_title} {staff_firstname} {staff_lastname}<br>
{staff_position}, {staff_department}<br>
{staff_email}</p>
```

!!! warning
    These codes are only filled in when an email has an identifiable staff sender, such as a message sent from the Messaging Centre. Many of ADAM’s automated emails — system notifications, report deliveries and the like — are sent on behalf of the school as a whole and have no individual sender. In those cases the sender detail codes are replaced with nothing, so be sure to design your template so that it still reads correctly when these details are absent.

#### Signature images

It is also possible, using the `{staffsignature}` code, to have ADAM insert an image signature for the sending staff member. ADAM uses the most recently uploaded file in that staff member’s **Email Signatures** document repository category, so to update a signature all you need to do is upload a new one.

To upload signatures in bulk, please look at the [Document Repository documentation for instructions](document-repository.md#uploading-documents-in-bulk).

You will need to ensure that your images are a suitable width, or that your template contains the necessary HTML to ensure that any over-sized images render correctly on narrower screens.

Note that if a staff member does not have a signature, ADAM will not put a “default” signature in its place, and instead, no image will be displayed.
