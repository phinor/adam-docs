"""MkDocs build-time hook: teach mkdocs-exporter how to print this theme.

Loaded only by `mkdocs.pdf.yml`; the website build never sees it.

Three things stand between this theme and a paginated PDF, and all of them are
silent failures — the build reports success and hands back blank or missing
pages — so each is worth recording.

**The exporter does not know this theme.** `mkdocs_exporter.themes.factory`
matches on `theme.name`, and ships adapters only for `material` and
`readthedocs`. A `custom_dir`-only theme like ours has `name: null`, so the
factory raises `RuntimeError` before a page is rendered. Registering an adapter
below is what makes the real theme usable; borrowing `readthedocs` instead
would silently apply another theme's assumptions to our markup.

**paged.js empties the page when a stylesheet mentions `position: fixed`.**
Its parser harvests *every* selector whose rule carries that declaration,
ignoring the media query the rule is nested in, then lifts the matching
elements out of the flow to repeat them on each page. `theme/css/styles.css`
declares `article { position: fixed }` inside `@media screen and (min-width:
640px)`, which makes the whole content container a fixed overlay: paged.js then
paginates an empty flow and every page comes out blank. No later override can
undo this — the declaration's presence is what counts, not whether it wins the
cascade — so the screen-only rules have to be gone before the CSS is parsed.
They mean nothing in print regardless.

**Two embeds stall the browser until it times out.** The Google CSE script
fetches cross-origin CSS that is refused under `file://`, and pagination never
completes. A YouTube iframe never settles either, so Playwright's `networkidle`
wait expires and the page is lost from the manual. Both are worthless on paper.

The chrome is removed from the DOM rather than hidden with CSS: `header` and
`nav` are `position: fixed` too, and paged.js mis-places the content when they
are present, `display: none` or not.

The adapter also prepares the DOM for `hooks/pdf_internal_links.py`, which
cannot do the work itself: the destinations a PDF can be sent to are decided
while the page is rendered, long before the manual it belongs to exists.
